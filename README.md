`prdoc` is a tool designed to help generating, checking and loading `.prdoc` files.
`.prdoc` files are YAML files adhering to defined JSON schema and helping with
code change documentation.

While platform like Github allow a simple description for a Pull Request (PR), this is
limited to a title, description and some labels.

The description of a PR itself is often used to describe the change but not
document it in a structured fashion.
A sample schema can be found here: [prdoc\_schema\_user.json](prdoc_schema_user.json) but each repository is free to
define its own JSON Schema.

## Features

-   [generate command](#_install) to create new PRDoc files

-   [scan command](#_scan): to quickly scan for PRDOc files in a folder

-   [check command](#_check): to check one or more PRDOc files

-   [load command](#_load): to load one or more PRDoc files

## Install

    cargo install prdoc

Alternatively, you may use a the container image if you prefer not installing anything on your system. See the
[Containers](#_containers) section for more details on containers.

## Philosophy

### Configuration, cli flags and environment variables

In order to provide a simple and uniform behavior in a repo, `prdoc` will search for a local configuration file.
The configuration file is a YAML file named `.prdoc.toml` or `prdoc.toml` and located in the root of the repo.

The configuration file can alternatively be passed via ENV (`PRDOC_CONFIG`) or cli flag (`-c`|`--config`).
ENV and cli flags have precedence over the local configuration file.

### Simple to use

While most commands supports options, they are designed to be simple to use and require a minimal amount of user input
when either a config or an `.env` file is present.

## Authoring a PRDoc

### Without tooling

No tooling but a text editor is required to author a new PRDoc. You may simply copy the template from your repo.
The template is defined in the [???](#config):

    grep template *prdoc.toml

You then need to save the file as `pr_NNNN.prdoc` (where `NNN` is the PR number) in the repo’s prdoc folder.
This folder is also defined in the config (`./prdoc` is the default\`):

    grep output *prdoc.toml

### Using the `prdoc` cli

You will however find it more convenient to [install](https://github.com/paritytech/prdoc#install) and use the `prddoc`
cli and just run:

    prdoc generate 9999

After editing the PRDoc file, you may check whether is adheres to the schema using:

    prdoc check check -n 1226

### Using VSCode

See the [Schemas](#_schemas) chapter to learn how to configure VSCode to recognize and check PRDoc files.

### YAML Anchors

You may use YAML anchors as demonnstrated below.

    # Schema: Parity PR Documentation Schema (prdoc)

    title: Foobar

    doc:
      - audience: Runtime User
        description: &desc |
          Sunt voluptate ad duis consequat ea in dolore non adipisicing incididunt
          ullamco enim qui enim.

      - audience: Validator
        description: *desc

    migrations:
      db: []
      runtime: []

    crates: []
    host_functions: []

## Config

Using a configuration file makes it easier for all users as they will be able to omit some of the required flags when
using the `prdoc`.

### Config file name and location

The config will be found if located at the root of the repo and named either:
- `prdoc.toml`
- `.prdoc.toml`

Alternatively, it can be defined as an ENV named `PRDOC_CONFIG` and contain the path of the config, relative to the
repository’s root.

### Content

    version = 1
    schema = "prdoc_schema_user.json"
    output_dir = "/tmp/prdoc"
    prdoc_folders = ["tests/data/all", "tests/data/some"]
    template = "template.prdoc"

## Paths

In order to make it easier to use, `prdoc` and its configuration always refer to the **root of the repository**.

It means you can pass either absolute paths or relative ones but relatives ones are based on the root of the repo and
**not** the current working directory.

This allows users to use commands such as:

    prdoc check -n 1234
    # instead of:
    # prdoc check -n 1234 -d ../../folder/where/prdoc_files/are/stored

Or also:

    prdoc generate 1234
    # instead of;
    # prdoc generate 1234 -o ../../folder/where/prdoc_files/are/stored

## Schemas

### PR Doc

The documentation for PRs comes as a file with the extension `.prdoc`.
This is essentially a `yaml` file and the extension helps using the right JSON schema to validate the file.

In VScode, open your user settings and ensure you have the following section:

You first need to tell VScode that .prdoc files are YAML files:

    "files.associations": {
        "*.prdoc": "yaml",
    },

You then need to point to the right schemas:

     "yaml.schemas": {
        [...other schemas...]
        "/path/to/polkadot-sdk/prdoc/schema_user.json": "*polkadot-sdk*/**/*.prdoc",
        "/path/to/subxt/prdoc/schema_user.json": "*subxt*/**/*.prdoc"
      },

You need to restart/reload VSCode after those changes for the new settings to be picked up.

Should you initially have created the file with another extension such as `.txt`, make sure to change the format to
`YAML` in the VSCode status bar and the right schema should then be picked up.

## Containers

If you prefer not having to install Rust & Cargo and have Podman or Docker installed, you may prefer to run a containerized
version of `prdoc`. This chapter explains how to proceed.

prdoc is designed to work at the repository level and you need to mount your repo as `/repo` into the prdoc container.

    podman run --rm -it -v $PWD:/repo paritytech/prdoc --help

        ENGINE=podman
        DOC_PATH="$PWD/tests/data/some"
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/repo paritytech/prdoc --help
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/repo paritytech/prdoc scan --all
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/repo paritytech/prdoc check
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/repo paritytech/prdoc load

The container image is working by default in `/repo` so it makes it simpler if you mount your repo there as shown
above.

### Run

    podman run --rm -it -v $PWD:/repo paritytech/prdoc --help

        ENGINE=podman
        DOC_PATH="$PWD/tests/data/some"
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/repo paritytech/prdoc --help
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/repo paritytech/prdoc scan --all
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/repo paritytech/prdoc check
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/repo paritytech/prdoc load

The container image is working by default in `/repo` so it makes it simpler if you mount your repo there as shown
above.

Commands can end up quite lengthy so you may like to set an alias:

        alias prdoc='podman run --rm -it -v $PWD:/repo paritytech/prdoc'

After setting this alias, you may use `prdoc` by simply invoking the `prdoc` command:

        prdoc --version

This is out of the scope of this documentation but note that you can just invoke `prdoc check` and expect it to work in
your repo as long as it contains a valid configuration file and schema. Check out the [???](#Configuration) chapter for more
details.

### Build

You can pull the container image from `paritytech`/`prdoc` or build you own:

        podman build -t prdoc .
