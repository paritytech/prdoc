`prdoc` is a tool helping with `.prdoc` files. `.prdoc` files are YAML files following a defined schema and helping with
code change documentation. While platform like Github allow a simple description for a Pull Request (PR), this is
limited to a title, description and some labels. The description itself is often used to describe the change but not
document it.

The schema can be found here: [prdoc\_schema\_user.json](prdoc_schema_user.json).

## Install

    cargo install prdoc

Alternatively, you may use a the container image if you prefer not installing anything on your system:

    podman run --rm -it -v $PWD:/doc paritytech/prdoc --help

        ENGINE=podman
        DOC_PATH="$PWD/tests/data/some"
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/doc paritytech/prdoc --help
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/doc paritytech/prdoc scan --all
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/doc paritytech/prdoc check
        $ENGINE run --rm -it -v $DOC_PATH:/doc paritytech/prdoc load

The container image is working by default in `/doc` so it makes it simpler if you mount your doc there as shown
above.

## Features

-   generate new documents

-   scan for `prdoc` in a folder

-   check `prdoc` files

-   load/aggregate `prdoc` files

## Philosophy

### Configuration, cli flags and environment variables

In order to provide a simple and uniform behavior in a repo, `prdoc` will search for a local configuration file.
The configuration file is a YAML file named `.prdoc.toml` or `prdoc.toml` and located in the root of the repo.

The configuration file can alternatively be passed via ENV or CLI flags. ENV and CLI flags have precedence over the
local configuration file.

### Simple to use

While most commands supports options, they are designed to be simple to use and require a minimal amount of user input
when either a config or an `.env` file is present.

## Authoring a PRDoc

You do not need any tooling but a text editor to author a new prdoc. You may simply copy
[this template](https://github.com/paritytech/prdoc/blob/master/template.prdoc) and save the file as `pr_##.prdoc`
(where `####` is the PR number) in the repoâ€™s prdoc folder (`./prdoc` is the default\`).

You will however find it more comfortable to [install](https://github.com/paritytech/prdoc#install) and use the `prddoc`
cli:
prdoc generate 9999

## Schemas

### PR Doc

The documentation for PRs comes as a file with the extension `.prdoc`.
This is essentially a `yaml` file and the extension helps using the right JSON schema to validate the file.

In VScode, open your user settings and ensure you have the following section:

    "yaml.schemas":  {
        "/path/of/schema/prdoc_schema_user.json": "*.prdoc"
    },

You also need:

    "files.associations": {
        "*.prdoc": "yaml",
    },

Should initially have created the file with another extension such as `.txt`, make sure to change the format to
`YAML` and the right schema should then be picked up.

### YAML Anchors

You may use YAML anchors as demonnstrated below.

## Docker

If you prefer not having to install Rust & Cargo and have Docker installed, you may prefer to run a containerized
version of `prdoc`. The next chapters explain how to proceed.

### Run

Docker commands can end up quite lengthy so you may like to set an alias:

        alias prdoc='docker run --rm -it prdoc'

After setting this alias, you may use `prdoc` by simply invoking the `prdoc` command:

        prdoc --version

If you prefer a shorter a command, you may set an alias for `rl` instead of `prdoc`.

This is out of the scope of this documentation but note that you cannot just invoke `prdoc` check and expect it to work on
your local `specs.yaml`. For that to work, you need to mount your `specs.yaml` into the container. That looks like this:

        docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/specs.yaml:/usr/local/bin/specs.yaml <literal>prdoc</literal> list

### Build

You can pull the docker image from `paritytech`/`prdoc` or build you own:

        docker build -t prdoc .
