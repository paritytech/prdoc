== Schemas

=== PR Doc

The documentation for PRs comes as a file with the extension `.prdoc`.
This is essentially a `yaml` file and the extension helps using the right JSON schema to validate the file.

In VScode, open your user settings and ensure you have the following section:

You first need to tell VScode that .prdoc files are YAML files:
----
"files.associations": {
    "*.prdoc": "yaml",
},
----

You then need to point to the right schemas:
----
 "yaml.schemas": {
    [...other schemas...]
    "/path/to/polkadot-sdk/prdoc/schema_user.json": "*polkadot-sdk*/**/*.prdoc",
    "/path/to/subxt/prdoc/schema_user.json": "*subxt*/**/*.prdoc"
  },
----

NOTE: You need to restart/reload VSCode after those changes for the new settings to be picked up.

NOTE: Should you initially have created the file with another extension such as `.txt`, make sure to change the format to
`YAML` in the VSCode status bar and the right schema should then be picked up.
