== Schemas

=== PR Doc

The documentation for PRs comes as a file with the extension `.prdoc`.
This is essentially a `yaml` file and the extension helps using the right JSON schema to validate the file.

In VScode, open your user settings and ensure you have the following section:

----
"yaml.schemas":  {
    "/path/of/schema/pr_doc.json": "*.prdoc"
},
----

NOTE: Should initially have created the file with another extension such as `.txt`, make sure to change the format to
`YAML` and the right schema should then be picked up.
