== Containers

If you prefer not having to install Rust & Cargo and have Podman or Docker installed, you may prefer to run a containerized
version of {cli}. The next chapters explain how to proceed.

{prj} is designed to work at the repository level and you need to mount your repo as `/repo` into the {prj} container.

=== Run

Commands can end up quite lengthy so you may like to set an alias:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    alias {prj}='podman run --rm -it -v $PWD:/repo {prj}'
----

After setting this alias, you may use {cli} by simply invoking the {cli} command:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    {prj} --version
----

This is out of the scope of this documentation but note that you cannot just invoke `{prj} check`` and expect it to work in
your repo as long as it contains a valid configuration file and schema.

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    podman run --rm -it -v $PWD/specs.yaml:/usr/local/bin/specs.yaml {cli} list
----

=== Build

You can pull the container image from `paritytech`/{cli} or build you own:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    podman build -t {prj} .
----
