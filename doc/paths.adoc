== Paths

In order to make it easier to use, {cli} and its configuration always refer to the **root of the repository**.

WARNING: It means you can pass either absolute paths or relative ones but relatives ones are based on the root of the repo and
**not** the current working directory.

This allows users to use commands such as:

    prdoc check -n 1234
    # instead of:
    # prdoc check -n 1234 -d ../../folder/where/prdoc_files/are/stored

Or also:

    prdoc generate 1234
    # instead of;
    # prdoc generate 1234 -o ../../folder/where/prdoc_files/are/stored
