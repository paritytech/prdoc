== Paths

In order to make it easier to use, {cli} and its configuration always refer to the root of the repository.

This allows users to use commands such as:

    prdoc check -n 1234

instead of:

    prdoc check -n 1234 -d ../../folder/where/prdoc_files/are/stored

Or also:

    prdoc generate 1234

instead of;

    prdoc generate 1234 -o ../../folder/where/prdoc_files/are/stored
