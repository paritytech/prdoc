== Authoring a PRDoc

You do not need any tooling but a text editor to author a new prdoc. You may simply copy
https://github.com/paritytech/prdoc/blob/master/template.prdoc[this template] and save the file as `pr_NNNN.prdoc`
(where `NNN` is the PR number) in the repo's prdoc folder (`./prdoc` is the default`).

You will however find it more comfortable to https://github.com/paritytech/prdoc#install[install] and use the `prddoc`
cli and just run `prdoc generate 9999`.
