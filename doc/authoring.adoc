== Authoring a PRDoc

=== Without tooling

No tooling but a text editor is required to author a new PRDoc. You may simply copy the template from your repo.
The template is defined in the <<config>>:
```
grep template *prdoc.toml
```

You then need to save the file as `pr_NNNN.prdoc` (where `NNN` is the PR number) in the repo's prdoc folder.
This folder is also defined in the config (`./prdoc` is the default`):
```
grep output *prdoc.toml
```

=== Using the `prdoc` cli

You will however find it more convenient to https://github.com/paritytech/prdoc#install[install] and use the `prddoc`
cli and just run:

```
prdoc generate 9999
```

After editing the PRDoc file, you may check whether is adheres to the schema using:

```
prdoc check check -n 1226
```

=== Using VSCode

See the <<Schemas>> chapter to learn how to configure VSCode to recognize and check PRDoc files.
