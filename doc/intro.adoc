`prdoc` is a tool designed to help generating, checking and loading `.prdoc` files.
`.prdoc` files are YAML files adhering to defined JSON schema and helping with
code change documentation.

While platform like Github allow a simple description for a Pull Request (PR), this is
limited to a title, description and some labels.

The description of a PR itself is often used to describe the change but not
document it in a structured fashion.
A sample schema can be found here: link:prdoc_schema_user.json[prdoc_schema_user.json] but each repository is free to
define its own JSON Schema.
