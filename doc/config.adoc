== Config

Using a configuration file makes it easier for all users as they will be able to omit some of the required flags when
using the {cli}.

=== Config file name and location

The config will be found if located at the root of the repo and named either:
- `prdoc.toml`
- `.prdoc.toml`

Alternatively, it can be defined as an ENV named `PRDOC_CONFIG` and contain the path of the config, relative to the
repository's root.
